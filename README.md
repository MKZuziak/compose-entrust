# ENTRUST compose

This repository contains a docker-compose setup intended for use toward the ENTRUST research project for development purposes locally and deployment to the Tellu R&I research cloud VM in AWS.

##### Note: If you're on Windows, make sure all .sh files use LF end of line sequence and not CRLF!

# Deploy
Use the following command in an appropriate terminal in the root folder of the repository:
You might need to run with "sudo" prefix.

1. docker-compose build
2. docker-compose up -d

# Copy repository to research project server (not possible to pull directly from github as-is)
1. Create a tarball of the repository locally (I've done it in Ubuntu by accessing the local repository through the /mnt/c/<path to repo>:
   ```
   tar czf compose-entrust.tar.gz compose-entrust
   ```
2. Push the tarball to the AWS server (requires ssh set up according to https://telludoc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TDO/pages/2675179619/AWS+Server+for+R+I+projects)
   ```
   scp -i ~/.ssh/eratosthenes.pem compose-entrust.tar.gz ubuntu@ec2-3-254-120-13.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:entrust
   ```
3. SSH into the remote server
   ```
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/eratosthenes.pem ubuntu@ec2-3-254-120-13.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
   ```
4. Extract the tarball
   ```
   cd entrust
   tar xzf compose-entrust.tar.gz
   ```

# Architecture


# Troubleshooting:
## mqtt-client
### ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused
Start the container with
```docker-compose up```
Afterwards (with the container still) running, in a separate terminal windows run a command:
```docker exec -it rabbitmq rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_mqtt```
This will enable rabbitmq-plugins.
